# Introduction

With Veasycard you can easily create vCards for your ruby models.

## Installation

Just add

    gem 'veasycard'

to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.

Alternatively you can run `gem install veasycard`.


Veasycard uses [vPim](https://github.com/sam-github/vpim) by _Sam Roberts_, which will be installed automatically.


## Usage

Just include `Veasycard` in the model for which you want to generate vCards.

    class User
      include Veasycard
    end

You can then create a vCard with the `vcard` method.

    u = User.new
    u.vcard(:format => :raw)


### Attribute mapping

If your modelâ€™s attributes use standard names, they will be mapped automatically.
For example this will work for any of the following attribute names which would fill in for the family name:

- family_name
- last_name
- surname

Similarly, these would be used for the given_name:

- given_name
- first_name
- christian_name
- forename

If however your model uses less common attribute names, you can map them manually like in this spanish example:

    class Persona
      include Veasycard

      attr_accessor :apellido, :nombre   # not necessary

      veasycard :family_name, :apellido
      veasycard :given_name, :nombre
    end
